Title: Quantum Entanglement
category: blog

I was just browsing through a book. And I just happened to come across this topic of quantum entanglement.

Without much beating around the bush, lets go directly to what it means.

Quantum Entanglement, from what I understand, says that a group of quantum particles are sort of "entangled" i.e. there is a particular characteristic about one that lets us determine that corresponding characteristic about the other particles of the group. The moment you determine a characteristic of one particle, you can be immediately sure about the characteristic of the others in the entangled group, irrespective of where they are positioned in the universe.  If you didnt get this on your first try, dont worry, even I took quite some time for this. 

Here is an analogy. Say you have a pair of shoes with you and two identical boxes. You randomly placed a shoe (randomly, remember!!) in one of the boxes (say, Box A) and the other shoe in the other box (say, Box B). Now you despatch the Box B on a ship to Antartica (or anywhere you would like the box to go). Now after some time, you open up Box A and find that you have the left shoe of the pair. This makes you realise instantaneously that the shoe in the other box is the right shoe of the pair. It is as if you have communicated with the other box.

If you have understood the analogy, great! But quantum entanglement is not as simple as this analogy. The shoes in the analogy had a vital piece of obvious information that they would exist in a left-right combination. But such piece of information is not applicable as far as quantum entanglement is concerned. 

This is the knowledge I have gained as of now! Keep watching this space for updates on this topic!

By the way, I never knew quantum physics could be so exciting. Those of who know me well, know that Quantum physics is not at all my cup of tea.
