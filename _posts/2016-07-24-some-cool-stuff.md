I would be writing about some cool stuff which I have encountered in my life (primarily on the internet);

# Slither.io

By far, this is the second most addictive game I have come across until now (first is FIFA). For those who have not tried it out yet, [here]( slither.io ) you go.

I spent the last few weeks mastering (read: wasting my time on) this game. After multiple nervous encounters with death (not to  me, to the player), I managed to be the highest ranked player in the game at that moment.

If you do not believe me, then here is the screenshot.
