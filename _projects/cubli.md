This project was done as part of the Institute Techincal Summer Projects which happen for freshmen in IIT Bombay at the end of their first year.

As a part of a team of 4, we tried to replicate the [Cubli]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_6p-1J551Y ), which was essentially a self-balancing cube. It worked on the principle of angular momentum conservation.

[Here]( https://stab-iitb.org/itsprandomap/documentation?id=46 ) is the complete documentation of the project. Go through that and do contact me if you want to know any further details about this project.
