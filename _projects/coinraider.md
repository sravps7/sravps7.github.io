This was a 3-4 day project developed in a team of 4 for participating in the **Lenovo Game Jam** orgainsed in association with the **Web and Coding Club of IIT Bombay**. The aim of the competition was to develop a game of a particular genre within a matter of 3-4 days.

We participated by the name of **Project C**, and were given the genre of [open world games]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world ) and were to get the game up and running within a matter of a few days. 

After a lot of ideation, a lot of fights, last moment change in plans, and of course multiple nightouts, we came up with the game of [CoinRaider]( https://github.com/sravps7/Project-C ). Do give this game a try and feel free to give me your opinion.

Enjoy!
