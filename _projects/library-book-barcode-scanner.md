This was a project done in my freshman year as part of the CS101 (Introduction to Computer Programming) course project. This involved using image processing to read the barcodes on the books.

We used the [ E-Yantra's Firebird V ]( http://www.nex-robotics.com/products/fire-bird-v-robots/fire-bird-v-atmega2560-robotic-research-platform.html ) as the mobile part of our bot. A web-cam was mounted on the bot which would get a video of the barcode on the book, identify the book and then make necessary changes in the database about the books availability and whereabouts. 

You can find further documentation (including the code and manuals) [here]( https://github.com/sravps7/library-book-barcode-scanner/tree/master/14D070012_404 ). Feel free to go through it.
