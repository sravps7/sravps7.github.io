This project was done as a part of the Electronic Design Lab, in my third year at IIT Bombay, in a team of three.

We made device which would be controlled using a web-application which would inturn control the voltage across any appliance. We made use of the trailing edge dimmer mechanism to change the voltage across the appliance and tested it successfully on an incandescent light bulb.
