This was a project I worked for during the summers after my second year in the institute. It involved concepts of both Machine Learning and Wireless Sensor Networks.

The problem statement was to effectively cluster a group of randomly placed nodes into efficient clusters so as to minimise the total energy used by the clusters as well as maintaining base station connectivity with each and every single sensor.

We also considered distribution of a particular set of jobs among the cluster-clowds in both time and energy minimising strategies.
