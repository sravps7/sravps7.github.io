I have done my schooling in quite some schools in Mumbai, Pune (located in India) and also in Manchester and Brighton (located in England).

I finished my schooling in Pawar Public School, Bhandup, Mumbai.

I then completed my Junior College at the Pace Junior Science College, Powai, Mumbai.

This was followed by me getting a rank of 433 out of 150,000 students in the prestigious Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Advanced for Engineering and a rank of 639 out of around 1,400,000 students in JEE Mains. I was duly admitted into the Electrical Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT B).
