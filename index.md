#  About Me

Hoping you are curious to know about me, here we go!

I am an engineering student staying in a relatively calm part of the busy city of Mumbai, India. I like to spend time with my close ones (that also includes non-living things like my laptop).

Coming to my academic standing, I am a Third year Electrical Engineering Undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, India. I am pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in the Electrical department with specialisation in Communication and Signal Processing.
 
I am very interested in learning new things related to engineering. I have particular interest in Robotics. I have been associated with the [Robotics Club of IIT Bombay]( https://stab-iitb.org/robotics-club/ ) right from my freshman year. I am currently the Manager of the Club. 

I am also a Mentor at the Department Academic Mentorship Programme at the Electrical Engineering Department ( [EE-DAMP]( https://dampeeiitb.wordpress.com/ ) ) where I help my juniors in adjusting to the academic and social life at the institute.

Apart from engineering and academics, I am very passionate about football as well. Also, I am an amateur violin player.

If I am not busy in some of these stuff, you might usually find me watching some mind-boggling movie or listening to a few songs on YouTube.
