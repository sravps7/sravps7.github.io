#  About Me

Hoping you are curious to know about me, here we go!

I am an engineering student staying in a relatively calm part of the busy city of Mumbai, India. I like to spend time with my close ones (that also includes non-living things like my laptop).

<<<<<<< HEAD
Coming to my academic standing, I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering Undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, India. I am pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in the Electrical department with specialisation in Communication and Signal Processing.
 
I am very passionate about math intensive tasks like probability, optimisation, machine learning and also signal processing. I am very interested in learning new things related to engineering. I have been involved heavily with the technical activities happening around in the institute right from my freshmen year, and now am the General Secretary of Technical Affairs of IIT Bombay. Previously, I was the manager of the Robotics Club of the institute. You can find more details and the website [here]( http://stab-iitb.org/ ). 

I was also a Student Mentor at the Department Academic Mentorship Programme at the Electrical Engineering Department ( [EE-DAMP]( https://dampeeiitb.wordpress.com/ ) ) where I helped a lot of my juniors in adjusting to the academic and social life at the institute.

Apart from engineering and academics, I am very passionate about football as well. Also, I am an amateur violin player.

If I am not busy in some of these stuff, you might usually find me watching some mind-boggling movie or listening to a few songs on YouTube.
