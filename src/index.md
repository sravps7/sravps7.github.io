# Hi there!

I’m currently an MBA candidate at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where I’m exploring the intersection of business and technology. My journey began with a passion for engineering, leading me to earn my Bachelors and Masters in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Mumbai.

I’ve had the privilege of working with innovative companies like NVIDIA and Qualcomm. At NVIDIA, I worked on their generative AI and digital twin solutions, while at Qualcomm, I contributed to their AI chips and autonomous driving technologies.
